## Setting up

The first step to setting up ERM is to invite the bot to your Discord Server!

### Basic Setup:
- Run /setup .
    - On the first dropdown that appears, select the role that you want to be able to access all staff-level commands. (View specific command permissions: Commands List)
    - On the second dropdown that appears, select the role that you want to be able to access all management-level commands.
    - On the third dropdown that appears, select the prefix that you want ERM to use. ERM always has slash command options, but some users prefer prefixed commands.
### HINT: Discord limits dropdowns to have 25 fields of data on each one. If you don't see your staff role, you may need to search it!

### Setup LOA Requests:
- Click on the arrow after you've finished Basic Setup.
    - On the first dropdown, select Enabled. (If you don't want to enable LOA Requests, simply click the arrow).
    - On the second dropdown, select the channel where all LOA Requests will be sent to.
    - On the third dropdown, select the role that should be given when someone is on LOA, and removed when they are off LOA.
    
### Setup RA Requests:
- Click on the arrow after you've completed Setup LOA Requests.
    - On the first dropdown, select the role that should be given when someone is on RA, and removed when they are off RA.

### Setup ROBLOX Punishments.
- Click on the arrow after you've completed Setup RA Requests.
    - On the first dropdown, select Enabled. (If you don't want to enable ROBLOX Punishments, simply click the arrow).
    - On the second dropdown, select the channel in which you want punishments to be logged.

### Setup Shift Logging.
- Click on the arrow after you've completed Setup ROBLOX Punishments.
    - On the first dropdown, select Enabled. (If you don't want to enable Shift Logging, simply click the arrow).
    - On the second dropdown, select the channel in which you want shifts to be logged.

### That's it!
Congratulations, you've set up ERM! However, there is much more to the configuration. I suggest that you look through all of the module pages to learn about each module and how it could benefit your server to set up.
