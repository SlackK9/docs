## Setting up

The first step to setting up ERM is to invite the bot to your Discord Server!

### Basic Setup:
-Run /setup .
    -On the first dropdown that appears, select the role that you want to be able to access all staff-level commands. (View specific command permissions: Commands List)
    -On the second dropdown that appears, select the role that you want to be able to access all management-level commands.
    -On the third dropdown that appears, select the prefix that you want ERM to use. ERM always has slash command options, but some users prefer prefixed commands.
### HINT: Discord limits dropdowns to have 25 fields of data on each one. If you don't see your staff role, you may need to search it!
